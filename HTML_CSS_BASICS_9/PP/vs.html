    <p>Samsung Galaxy (stylised as SAMSUNG Galaxy, previously Samsung GALAXY) is a series of mobile computing devices designed, manufactured and marketed by Samsung Electronics. The product line includes the Galaxy S series of high-end smartphones, the Galaxy Tab series of tablets, the Galaxy Note series of tablets and phablets with the added functionality of a stylus, and the first version of the Galaxy Gear smartwatch, with later versions dropping the Galaxy branding. </p>
    <p>Samsung Galaxy devices have traditionally used the Android operating system produced by Google, usually with a custom user interface called TouchWiz/Samsung Experience. This tradition was broken at CES 2016 with the announcement of the first Galaxy-branded Windows 10 device, the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S.

The S7 and S8 Galaxy devices come with a file transfer app (Smart Switch) pre-loaded, with no app icon. Smart Switch works with all recent Galaxy devices, from the S2 through to current models. </p>
