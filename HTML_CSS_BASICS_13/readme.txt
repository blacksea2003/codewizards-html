## Styles for cookie.html

* The html tag should have styles as follows:
** text-align center,
** a colored background, 'darkslategrey' is a good color for background.
** Font family needs to be 'Sacramento'

* H1, should have a font-size of 60px

* H2,should have white color, with font-size of 30px,

* we don't want both H1 and H2 to be bold so font-weight:normal;.

* button tag needs to have a transparent background, with border none and border-radius 50%. Width and height of this button should be equal, 100px would do good.

* on button:hover, make it have a border of 1px dashed and color black.

* img , which is the cookie itself needs to have a width which is equal to button tag a.k.a 100px.

* .box, class for box that contains all the cookies. It needs to have background as white, border radius as 15px , width of 600px. It needs padding of 25px everywhere except padding-bottom which needs to be 60px; Margin needs to be auto everywhere except margin-top, which needs to be 100px;
